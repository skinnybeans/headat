I work with young people and adults from all walks of life. 
Some are living with depression, anxiety or chronic pain. Others are struggling with substance abuse, identity issues, and relationships.

Everyone’s story is different. 
And while it’s difficult to talk about the things that cause us pain, I believe we all have the capacity to lead a happier more fulfilling life. 

Acceptance takes work, but therapy gives you the tools and skills to become more resilient, and more aware of the thoughts and habits that stifle personal growth.
Some of the approaches I use in my sessions are Interpersonal Therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Schema Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Mindfulness, Relaxation and Clinical Hypnosis.
