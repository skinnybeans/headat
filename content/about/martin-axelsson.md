Martin is a psychologist who works with adolescents and adults.

With experience in private practice and community services, Martin values genuine relationships with his clients. He understands how difficult it can be to talk about things that cause us pain – and knows that acceptance takes work. But he believes that everyone has the capacity to lead a happier, more fulfilling life.

Martin has worked with people living with anxiety, depression, stress and chronic pain. As well as individuals struggling with substance use, self-esteem, identity, relationships or sleep.

Everyone’s story is different and Martin uses insights that each client brings to help them become more aware of the habits and thoughts that stifle personal growth. 

His therapeutic approach draws on Interpersonal Therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Schema Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mindfulness, Relaxation and Clinical Hypnosis.
